# Project Next Steps

**Last Updated**: 2026-02-05
**Current Phase**: Phase D (Web Workflow Builder)

## What's Next

Phase D: Web app to build/edit workflow YAML; project status dashboard with selector; pending messages.

## How to Start

1. **Workflow exists**: Say "Execute workflows/phase-d-web-workflow-builder-workflow.yaml"
2. **Prerequisites**: setup_git_phase_d and validate_git_phase_d scripts exist for Phase D branch (`feature/phase-d-web-workflow-builder`).

## How to Ask

Say any of: "Start the next sprint", "How do I start the next sprint?", "Start Phase D", "How to proceed?", "What's next?"

## Resume (if paused)

Say "resume-sprint" or "resume project orchestration-training"

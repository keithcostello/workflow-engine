# Bug Report: review_20260205_230152

## Task ID
review

## Issue Description
**File Not Found**: The file specified for review (`artifacts/demo.txt`) does not exist in the repository.

## Location
- **Expected file**: `artifacts/demo.txt`
- **Artifacts directory contents**:
  - adhoc-demo.txt
  - custom-demo.txt
  - full-orchestration-validation-demo.txt
  - validation-demo.txt

## Root Cause
The requested file path does not match any existing file. Either:
1. The file was never created
2. The file path in the task params is incorrect
3. The file was deleted or moved

## Suggested Fix
1. **Option A**: Create the missing file `artifacts/demo.txt` with appropriate content
2. **Option B**: Update the task params to reference an existing file (e.g., `artifacts/validation-demo.txt`)
3. **Option C**: Verify the workflow definition to ensure correct file paths are specified

## Severity
**Blocking** - Cannot proceed with review until file exists
